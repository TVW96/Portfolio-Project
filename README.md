# Portfolio Project
a Web Fundamentals Portfolio Project

## Development Timeline
- [x] Week 1 (this week): Project introduction, begin researching content.
- [x] Week 2: Start building a simple html/css version of your project.
- [ ] Week 3: Use Bootstrap classes to add more visual content to your project and make it mobile-responsive.
- [ ] Week 4: Explore using Bootstrap templates, or continue adding to your project with interactive Bootstrap components.
      
Project Weeks (following the end of the course): Finalize, test, and deploy your finished project.
Note: if you are continuing on to the Front-End or Full-Stack bootcamps after completing this course, you will have a 3-week break before your next module. This time is yours to continue working on your project, get feedback from your classmates, finalize and publish your project, and review what you have learned. Later in the program, you will have a 1-week "Project Week" break between every module to finalize and publish your projects before the next module begins.

## Project Description, Requirements and Scope
The required project for this course is a personal portfolio webpage, which you will later use to showcase your skills and other projects to future employers.
You must complete this project independently.
### Your project must use:
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] CSS
- [ ] Bootstrap
      
(You may optionally choose to include SCSS or other style frameworks in addition to these.)
### Your project must be mobile-responsive for different screen sizes (more on this in a future lesson).
You may use a Bootstrap template or theme to design your webpage (more on this in a future lesson).

### Your project should be simple enough in scope that you will be able to complete and publish your finished webpage by the end of this course or soon after, and complex enough to adequately showcase your skills with the three core technologies of this course.
At the end of this course, you will submit your finished project to the course forum for peer review by your classmates.
